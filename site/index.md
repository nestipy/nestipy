# Introduction

**Nestipy** is a Python framework inspired by NestJS and built on top of **FastAPI** or **Blacksheep**. It adheres to
NestJS's modular architecture, offering a structured approach to developing APIs that's intuitive and enjoyable.
With Nestipy, developers can create scalable and maintainable APIs effortlessly. The framework embraces key features
like dependency injection, type annotations, decorators, and code generation, facilitating the creation of clean and
testable codebases.<br/>
Notably, Nestipy extends its functionality to support **GraphQL** through integration with **Strawberry**. This
allows developers to harness the power and flexibility of GraphQL within the Nestipy framework.

### Installation

To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the **Nestipy CLI**.

```bash

pip install nestipy-cli
nestipy new project-name
```

## Documentation
